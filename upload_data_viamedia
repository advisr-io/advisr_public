## Introduction
This guide provides instructions on how to upload files to Google Cloud Storage (GCS) using the `gcloud` CLI. You can also upload files using REST APIs or Googleâ€™s client libraries for languages like Python, C++, Java, Node.js, etc.

## Step-by-step Guide

### Step 0: Install gcloud CLI
The Google Cloud Command Line Interface (CLI) allows you to interact with Google Cloud services, including GCS. To install the `gcloud` CLI, follow the installation guide here: [Install gcloud CLI](https://cloud.google.com/sdk/docs/install).

### Step 1: Login
To log in, run the following command in your terminal. This will open a browser window where you'll log in using your Google account.

```bash
gcloud auth login
```

Verify that you're logged in with the correct account by running:

```bash
gcloud auth list
```

If necessary, switch accounts using:

```bash
gcloud config set account advisr-viamedia-data-transfer@looker-testing-394720.iam.gserviceaccount.com
```

### Step 2: Set the GCP Project
Set the project ID as an environment variable.

```bash
export PROJECT_ID=looker-testing-394720
```

Then, configure `gcloud` to use the correct project:

```bash
gcloud config set project $PROJECT_ID
```

Verify the active project with:

```bash
gcloud config get project
```

### Step 3: Upload File to GCS Bucket
Define your destination GCS bucket as an environment variable.

```bash
export GCS_BUCKET=gs://advisr-viamedia-data-share
```

Check the contents of the bucket:

```bash
gcloud storage ls ${GCS_BUCKET}
```

Upload your file from your local filesystem to the GCS bucket. Replace `your_file.csv` with the actual file name.

```bash
gcloud storage cp your_file.csv $GCS_BUCKET
```

Ensure your file was uploaded by listing the contents of the bucket again:

```bash
gcloud storage ls ${GCS_BUCKET}
```

If the file was successfully uploaded, it should appear in the list.
